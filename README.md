# Project_Image_Flower_Classifier

Here is my 2nd Project for the Udacity Introduction to Machine Learning with Tensorflow.

The main things I do in this project are:

-Load the MobileNet pre-trained network from TensorFlow Hub.
-Define a new, untrained feed-forward network as a classifier.
-Train the classifier.
-Plot the loss and accuracy values achieved during training for the training and validation set.
-Save your trained model as a Keras model.

Finallly I use the saved trained model and write a simple Python program that will predict the flower class after I input an image.
